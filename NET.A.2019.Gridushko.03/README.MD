## Statements of the task:  

- 1. Develop a class that allows you to perform GCD calculations using the Euclidean algorithm for two, three, etc. integers.
  Class methods in addition to computing GCD must determine the value of time required to perform the calculation.
  Add to the developed class methods that implement the Stein algorithm (binary Euclidean algorithm) 
  for calculating the GCD of two, three, etc. integers. 
  Methods should also determine the value of time required to perform the calculations. 
  Develop unit tests for testing methods of this type.
- 2. Implement an extension method to get a string binary double-precision representations 
  in IEEE 754 format (it is advisable not to use ready-made converter classes). Develop unit tests.
